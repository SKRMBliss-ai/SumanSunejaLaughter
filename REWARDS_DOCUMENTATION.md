## 4. Streak Power logic
This statistic appears on the User Profile to visualize the strength of their current consistency.

*   **Formula:** `Current Active Streak` × `20`
*   **Example Calculation:**
    *   Streak: **22 Days**
    *   Calculation: 22 × 20
    *   **Display Value:** **440 Streak Power**
*   **Purpose:** A simplified "Power Score" that reinforces the value of the daily 20-point bonus without confusing the total point balance.
