## Option 2: Manual Script (If you want to paste the text directly)

If you prefer to manually input the text for each step, here is a polished script:

### **Step 1: Reviewing the Leaderboard**
*(Context: User clicks the 'Leaderboard' button)*
**Voiceover:**
"Staying consistent with your wellness journey is easier when you're not alone. Tap the Leaderboard to see how your daily laughter streaks compare with our global community of joy-seekers!"

### **Step 2: Your Personal Rank**
*(Context: Highlighting the 'Your Rank' footer)*
**Voiceover:**
"No need to scroll endlessly! Your personal standing and current points are always highlighted right here at the bottom, celebrating your progress every single day."

### **Step 3: The Rewards Shop**
*(Context: User opens the 'Rewards' modal)*
**Voiceover:**
"And the best part? Every laugh counts. In the Rewards Shop, your healthy habits turn into real value. You earn points for daily logins, completing sessions, or just sharing the joy."

### **Step 4: Earning & Redeeming**
*(Context: Showing the 'How to Earn' list)*
**Voiceover:**
"Watch your balance grow and redeem your points for exclusive badges and coupons. Keep laughing, keep earning, and let joy be your currency!"
